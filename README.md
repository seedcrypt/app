# seedcrypt
This is a simple application to encrypt and decrypt a BIP39 seed phrase using a key.
It uses the BIP39 wordlist for autocompletion during input.

## TODO:
- domains: seedcrypt.app and seedcrypt.io
- extract `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions to npm library
- add docs
- github actions for `sls deploy`
- add pages with information to the app + SEO
- styles?
